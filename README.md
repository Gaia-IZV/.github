Welcome to **Gaia**, a collaborative GitHub organization dedicated to developing AI-powered solutions for plant identification and care.

## About Us

Gaia brings together a team of developers passionate about applying machine learning to botany. Our goal is to create tools that make plant care easier, more accurate, and accessible to everyone.

## What We Do

- **Image-based Plant Identification**  
  We develop and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify plant species from images. We also integrate pre-trained models from Hugging Face for benchmarking and comparison.

- **Plant Care Language Model**  
  We train language models to provide personalized and informative advice for plant care, helping users understand how to nurture their plants effectively.
