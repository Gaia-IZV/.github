  - This is the public-facing README visible on the Gaia organization page.
- **Assets** (`assets/`)  
  - Logos and images used in organization profiles and documentation.
- **Templates and GitHub configuration**  
  - Issue templates, pull request templates, and other default GitHub settings for the organization.
